[About Me](url)
My name is Ricky! I am a first year student in UCF's Text and Technology PhD program. I have a Masters in Composition Rhetoric and Digital Media and Bachelor's in English. This summer I am working on an independent study which focuses on Twine as a game and E-lit platform. I am using this study as an oppurtunity to explore and create through Twine. If you have any questions, comments or ideas feel free to contact me. 

PS: If you liked the theme, do star it on GitHub!
